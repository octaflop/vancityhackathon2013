This repo contains some programming examples showing how to access and use the data provided by the City of Vancouver in various ways.

## Examples:

* `beautiful_trees.py` *python* â†’ an example of the Vancouver tree database in action. This script will combine all of the json files into a single array and sort the trees by species. For each species, the script will find a wikimedia picture of the species (if it's available). Example of **json**, **urllib**, and **beautiful soup**.


Other examples are forthcoming as the event progresses.
